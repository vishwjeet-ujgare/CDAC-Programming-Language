------------------------------------------------
Exercise : Exceptions
-------------------------------------------------

1) Write a program that creates a dictionary like this 
{
    1: "red" , 2: "Blue" , 3: "Orange"
}
Now take the key as input from the user and print its corresponding colour 
(Exception handle the code to terminate gracefully by printing 
Colour not found if the key doesnot exists )




2) Write a program that creates a list of 5 elements of your choice 
Now take the index that the user want the data of and print the value at that 
location 
Exception handle the code to  terminate gracefully by printing 
Value not found if the index doesnot exists 




3) Create program that takes age of the user as input 
and prints number of days that user has lived for 
Exception handle the code such that if the user has lived for more than 
100001 days then user should get the message
, you lived for so long , may be you will die soon:)





4)Create the following program named "my_exception_store" with the menu below :

Welcome User , What would you like to do today ?
    1) Create a postive numbered list 
    Note : raise an exception if the users inserts a negative number OR user creates an empty list 
    2) Create a negative  numbered list 
    Note : raise an exception if the users inserts a positive number/Zero OR user creates an empty list
    3) Create a heterogenous list 
    Note : raise an exception if the users creates a homogenous list (all elements of same datatype)

    4) Refresh the program to start with blank lists
    5) Exit

Handle exceptions in the script for all operations 
and let the user continue till he chooses to exit from the program 

# reference code :

def my_exception_store(): 
    my_int_list1=[]
    my_int_list2=[]
    my_het_list3=[]

    while(True):
        try:
            print("Welcome to my_exception_store !!!!")
            print("-------------------------------------")
            print("Following operations are supported :")
            print("1) Create a positive numbered list  ")
            print("2) Create a negative numbered list  ")
            print("3) Refresh the program to start with blank lists")
            print("4) Exit  ")
            
            choice = int(input("Please enter your choice !!!! "))
            if choice ==1:
                create_positive_numbered_list(my_int_list1)
            elif choice ==2:
                create_negative_numbered_list(my_int_list2)
            elif choice ==3:
                my_int_list1.clear()
                my_int_list2.clear()
                my_het_list3.clear()
                print("Store restarted !!!! ")
            elif choice ==4:
                break
            else:
                print("Please choose something from the above")
        except negative_number_error:     
            print("We received a negative number in the list and I handled negative_number_error exception")
            my_int_list1.clear()
        except positive_number_error:     
            print("We received a positive number in the list and I handled positive_number_error exception")
            my_int_list2.clear()
            
my_exception_store()
